# Inventory-Management-System-

# Overview
This project focuses on optimizing point-of-sale (POS) data processing and storage by leveraging AWS-based server architecture and transitioning from relational databases to a NoSQL model for enhanced scalability and performance.

# Key Features & Implementation
1. AWS-Based Server Architecture: Designed and deployed a scalable EC2-based architecture running MariaDB on Linux to efficiently handle POS data processing.

2. Optimized ETL Pipeline: Developed a high-performance ETL pipeline using PL/SQL, improving data extraction, transformation, and loading processes while enhancing data architecture efficiency by 50%.

3. Database Migration (Relational to NoSQL): Seamlessly migrated from a relational database (MariaDB) to MongoDB, demonstrating adaptability to different database paradigms for improved flexibility and query performance.

4. Performance Enhancements: The new architecture and ETL design significantly reduced query execution times and improved overall system scalability and efficiency.
